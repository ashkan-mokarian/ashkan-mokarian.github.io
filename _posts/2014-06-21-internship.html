<span style="font-weight:bold;">Graph decomposition with long range edges - a technical report of the winter 2013 internship at Combinatorial Image analysis group.</span>
Graph decomposition is a basic tool in many combinatorial problems. Here, we investigate the facet defining conditions in general graphs in presence of long range edges putting force on connectedness. In this work, after defining the problem formally, we show the polytope to be full-dimensional. Moreover, we find several neccessary conditions for the facets which show to be sufficient for several constrained graphs but not for the general case. This work was left uncomplete, since the summer semester had already begun. I hope to go back to the problem as soon as I find time again.
