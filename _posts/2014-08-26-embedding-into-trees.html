<span style="font-weight:bold;">Metric embedding into distribution of trees - talk.</span><br>
My talk as a final project for the course "Random Discrete Structures".
[<a href="/assets/embedding-into-trees.pdf" style="color: #258;text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">slides</a>]

<p>
In this presentation, I mainly used the blackboard since using a slower media like blackboard let the audience to follow better for topics like this. But I used slides to bring definitions and theorem statements.
</p>
<p>
In the first part, basic definitions about metrics is introduced. In the second part, the prove of Bartal's theorem is shown, but instead of the randomized decomposition procedure used in the original paper, we prove it by using the procedure in Calinescu, Karloff and Rabani(2001) paper. And hence, by slightly tightening the bound, we can move straight to Fakcharoenphol, Rao, and Talwar(2003) embedding theorem with lower distortion.

I used material from the following courses, which are very well documented and give a very goof guidline for self-studying into metrics and embeddings: <br>
